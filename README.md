# SocialSpark
SocialSpark is the back end for your social network application! Built with Express.js, this API uses Mongoose to interact with a MongoDB database, making it ideal for handling large amounts of unstructured data in a NoSQL environment.

SocialSpark lets you easily manage users, posts, and reactions.

- Link to MongoDB quickly. Just add your database info to the connection.js file.

- Start your server and watch Mongoose sync your models automatically.

- Manage users with API calls. Add, update, or remove profiles with a couple clicks.

- Post thoughts and reactions. The routes handle all the create, update, and delete actions.

- Build relationships easily. The API endpoints make adding or removing friends a breeze.

- Test it in Insomnia. See your data in a clean JSON format as you work.
